# DimRed_cross_validation

A SciKit-Learn implementation of CV evaluation of dimensionality reduction methods, as proposed in this Alex Williams blog: http://alexhwilliams.info/itsneuronalblog/2018/02/26/crossval/

## TODOs:
[x] Write code for cross validation procedure
[] Write an example notebook to display operation
[] Share a conda environment for reproducible execution

All communication and PRs welcome - let's do this together, Hubbers!
